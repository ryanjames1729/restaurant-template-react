# restaurant-template-react

This is me playing around with NextJS to create a React version of my [static restaurant template](https://ryanjames1729.github.io/template-restaurant/) that I created earlier this year.

I also created a quick API that is exporting props to the page components so that to change the menu, the JSON object thats in the props just needs to be changd. Enjoy!
